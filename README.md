## Inspiration
Coming from India, we are not really used to mixers. And we found it really hard to break the ice with people outside our social circles, when we go to `Grads n Grub` and other UCSD mixers. So we wanted to build something that helps people get more social.

## What it does
Form intelligent groups to break the ice at the event. Emails can be sent through SparkPost, to the groups formed, which then serves as the medium for further activities. Features like double-blind messaging, polls, raffles provided by SparkPost, help in socializing.

## How we built it
AnuglarJS, Bootstrap, Python-flask, Relational Data Store

## Challenges we ran into
1. Integrating SparkPost
2. Processing input data and manipulating it

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Solved an easy problem with an effective solution which has a huge impact

## What we learned
Teamwork, distribution of responsibilities, making use of individual strengths and finally time management

## What's next for Go Caboodle
Organize events from Go Caboodle or integrate with EventBrite, Facebook events, etc.
